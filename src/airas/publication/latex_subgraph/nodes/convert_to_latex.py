convert_to_latex_prompt = """
You are a LaTeX expert. 
Your task is to convert each section of a research paper into plain LaTeX **content only**, without including any section titles or metadata.

Below are the paper sections. For each one, convert only the **content** into LaTeX:
{% for section in sections %}
---
Section: {{ section.name }}

{{ section.content }}

---
{% endfor %}

## LaTeX Formatting Rules:
- Use \\subsection{...} for any subsections within this section.
    - Subsection titles should be distinct from the section name;
    - Do not use '\\subsection{ {{ section }} }', or other slight variations. Use more descriptive and unique titles.
    - Avoid excessive subdivision. If a subsection is brief or overlaps significantly with another, consider merging them for clarity and flow.

- For listing contributions, use the LaTeX \\begin{itemize}...\\end{itemize} format.
    - Each item should start with a short title in \\textbf{...} format. 
    - Avoid using -, *, or other Markdown bullet styles.

- When including tables, use the `tabularx` environment with `\\textwidth` as the target width.
    - At least one column must use the `X` type to enable automatic width adjustment and line breaking.
    - Include `\\hline` at the top, after the header, and at the bottom. Avoid vertical lines unless necessary.
    - To left-align content in `X` columns, define `\newcolumntype{Y}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X}` using the `array` package.

- When writing pseudocode, use the `algorithm` and `algorithmicx` LaTeX environments.
    - Only include pseudocode in the `Method` section. Pseudocode is not allowed in any other sections.
    - Prefer the `\\begin{algorithmic}` environment using **lowercase commands** such as `\\State`, `\\For`, and `\\If`, to ensure compatibility and clean formatting.
    - Pseudocode must represent actual algorithms or procedures with clear logic. Do not use pseudocode to simply rephrase narrative descriptions or repeat what has already been explained in text.
        - Good Example:
        ```latex
        \\State Compute transformed tokens: \\(\tilde{T} \\leftarrow W\\,T\\)
        \\State Update: \\(T_{new} \\leftarrow \tilde{T} + \\mu\\,T_{prev}\\)
        ```
- Figures and images are ONLY allowed in the "Results" section. 
    - Use LaTeX float option `[H]` to force placement.  

- All figures must be inserted using the following LaTeX format, using a `width` that reflects the filename:
    ```latex
    \\includegraphics[width=<appropriate-width>]{images/filename.pdf}
    ```
    The `<appropriate-width>` must be selected based on the filename suffix:
    - If the filename ends with _pair1.pdf or _pair2.pdf, use 0.48\\linewidth and place the figures side by side using subfigure blocks
    - Otherwise (default), use 0.7\\linewidth

- When referring to file names, commands, or code snippets, do not use the \\texttt{} command or any monospaced font environments. 
    - Instead, use plain text with single quotes (e.g., 'main.py', '--config'), and escape special characters such as underscores using `\\_` (e.g., 'config\\_file.yaml'). 

- Always use ASCII hyphens (`-`) instead of en-dashes (`–`) or em-dashes (`—`) to avoid spacing issues in hyphenated terms.

- Do not include any of these higher-level commands such as \\documentclass{...}, \\begin{document}, and \\end{document}.
    - Additionally, avoid including section-specific commands such as \\begin{abstract}, \\section{ {{ section }} }, or any other similar environment definitions.

- Be sure to use \\cite or \\citet where relevant, referring to the works provided in the file.
    - **Do not cite anything that is not already in `references.bib`. Do not add any new entries to this.
