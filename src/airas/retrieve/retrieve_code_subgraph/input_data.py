Existing discrete graph diffusion models exhibit\\nheightened computational complexity and diminished training efficiency. A\\npreferable and natural way is to directly diffuse the graph within the latent\\nspace. However, due to the non-Euclidean structure of graphs is not isotropic\\nin the latent space, the existing latent diffusion models effectively make it\\ndifficult to capture and preserve the topological information of graphs. To\\naddress the above challenges, we propose a novel geometrically latent diffusion\\nframework HypDiff. Specifically, we first establish a geometrically latent\\nspace with interpretability measures based on hyperbolic geometry, to define\\nanisotropic latent diffusion processes for graphs. Then, we propose a\\ngeometrically latent diffusion process that is constrained by both radial and\\nangular geometric properties, thereby ensuring the preservation of the original\\ntopological properties in the generative graphs. Extensive experimental results\\ndemonstrate the superior effectiveness of HypDiff for graph generation with\\nvarious topologies.","github_url":"https://github.com/RingBDStack/HypDiff","main_contributions":"The paper introduces HypDiff, a novel hyperbolic geometric latent diffusion model for graph generation. It addresses the challenges of high computational complexity and anisotropy in non-Euclidean graph structures by establishing a geometrically latent space with interpretability measures based on hyperbolic geometry. The key contribution is a geometrically latent diffusion process constrained by radial and angular geometric properties, preserving original topological properties in generated graphs.","methodology":"HypDiff employs a two-stage training strategy: first, a hyperbolic autoencoder is trained to obtain pre-trained node embeddings; second, a hyperbolic geometric latent diffusion process is trained. The model uses hyperbolic geometric encoders (HGCN) and a Fermi-Dirac decoder. It introduces an approximate diffusion process based on radial measures and utilizes angular constraints to guide the diffusion model.","experimental_setup":"The model was evaluated on synthetic datasets (SBM, BA, Community, Ego, BA-G, Grid) and real-world datasets (Cora, Citeseer, Polblogs, MUTAG, IMDB-B, PROTEINS, COLLAB). Node classification performance was measured using F1 scores. Graph generation was evaluated using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) for Degree, Cluster, and Spectre, and F1 scores for precision-recall (F1 pr) and density-coverage (F1 dc).","limitations":"The paper does not explicitly state the limitations. However, based on the content, a potential limitation lies in the approximation of Gaussian distribution in hyperbolic space due to the additive failure of Gaussian distribution, which may affect the accuracy of the model. Also, the model\'s performance might be sensitive to the choice of the hyperbolic clustering parameter k and the geometric prior coefficient δ.","future_research_directions":"The paper does not explicitly suggest future research directions. However, potential directions could include: (1) exploring alternative methods to address the additivity issue of Gaussian distributions in hyperbolic space, (2) investigating adaptive methods for selecting the optimal hyperbolic clustering parameter k and geometric prior coefficient δ based on graph structure, and (3) extending the model to handle dynamic graphs or graphs with node/edge features."}',
