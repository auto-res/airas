            'Abstractâ€”Robust matrix completion (RMC) is a widely used machine learning tool that '
            'simultaneously tackles two critical issues in low-rank data analysis: missing data entries and '
            'extreme outliers. This paper proposes a novel scalable and learnable non-convex approach, '
            'coined Learned Robust Matrix Completion (LRMC), for large-scale RMC problems. LRMC enjoys '
            'low computationa'

                'such as reinforcement learning, could open new avenues for handling more complex low-rank '
