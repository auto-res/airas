The proposed method synergistically combines the advantages of AggMo's aggregated momentum with MADGRAD's adaptive updates. This is achieved by integrating the multiple momentum terms of AggMo to adjust the parameters within MADGRAD's dual averaging scheme based on cumulative gradient history. This hybrid approach aims to maintain stability while leveraging adaptivity, leading to accelerated convergence during varied machine learning tasks.
""",
    "new_novelty": """
The novelty lies in blending the momentum aggregation concept from AggMo with the adaptive gradient updates of MADGRAD. This creates a unique optimizer that dynamically balances momentum and adaptiveness, tailored for tasks requiring quick dampening of instabilities while sustaining adaptiveness for varying gradient scales.
""",
    "new_experimental_procedure": """
To validate this hybrid optimization method, compare it against AggMo, MADGRAD, SGD, and Adam optimizers in various standard benchmarks such as CIFAR-10 for image classification, and PTB for language modeling. Evaluate their performance based on convergence rates, final accuracies, and generalization capabilities.
