You are tasked with filling in the '{{ section }}' section of a research paper.

A complete LaTeX template is already in place.
Your role is to generate the LaTeX content specifically for the designated section, such as text, equations, figures, tables, and citations—all within the existing document structure.

The generated text should be output as a value for the key “generated_paper_text”.
The value of "generated_paper_text" should be the content of the '{{ section }}' section in LaTeX format.

Some tips are provided below:
{{ tips }}

Here is the context of the entire paper:
{{ note }}

**Instructions**:
- Use ONLY the provided information in the context. 
    - **DO NOT add any assumptions, invented data, or details that are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
- **Use ALL information from '{{ note }}'.** However, you are free to organize and structure the content in a natural and logical way, rather than directly following the order or format of `{{ note }}`
    - **It is mandatory to include all details related to methods, experiments, and results.**
    - **Ensure all mathematical equations, pseudocode, experimental setups, configurations, numerical results, and figures/tables are fully incorporated.**
    - When beneficial for clarity, utilize tables or pseudocode to describe mathematical equations, parameter settings, and procedural steps.
    - Avoid overly explanatory or repetitive descriptions that would be self-evident to readers familiar with standard machine learning notation.
- Avoid editor instructions, placeholders, speculative text, or comments like "details are missing."
    - Example: Remove phrases like "Here’s a refined version of the '{{ section }}'," as they are not part of the final document.
    - These phrases are found at the beginning of sections, introducing edits or refinements. Carefully review the start of each section for such instructions and ensure they are eliminated while preserving the actual content.
- **Use \\subsection{...} for any subsections within this section.**
    - Subsection titles should be distinct from the '{{ section }}' title. 
    - **Do not use '\\subsection{ {{ section }} }', or other slight variations. Use more descriptive and unique titles.
    - Avoid creating too many subsections. If the content of a subsection is brief or overlaps significantly with other subsections, merge them to streamline the document. Focus on clarity and brevity over excessive structural division.
- Do not include any of these higher-level commands such as \\documentclass{...}, \\begin{document}, and \\end{document}.
    - Additionally, avoid including section-specific commands such as \\begin{abstract}, \\section{ {{ section }} }, or any other similar environment definitions.
- Be sure to use \cite or \citet where relevant, referring to the works provided in the file.
    - **Do not cite anything that is not already in `references.bib`. Do not add any new entries to this.
- Keep the experimental results (figures and tables) only in the Results section, and make sure that any captions are filled in.
- The full paper should be **about 8 pages long**, meaning **each section should contain substantial content**.
