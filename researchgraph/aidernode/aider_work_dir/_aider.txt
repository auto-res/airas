#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

To implement the idea of running the experiment with more "cool tricks," we can plan a series of experiments that explore different hyperparameters or techniques that might improve the diffusion model's performance. Here is a proposed list of experiments:

1. **Experiment 1 (run_1):** Increase the number of timesteps in the noise scheduler to see if a finer granularity improves the model's performance.
2. **Experiment 2 (run_2):** Use a different beta schedule, such as "quadratic," to see if it affects the model's learning dynamics.
3. **Experiment 3 (run_3):** Increase the hidden layers in the MLPDenoiser to see if a deeper network improves the model's capacity to learn complex patterns.
4. **Experiment 4 (run_4):** Implement a learning rate scheduler with a different strategy, such as a step decay, to see if it helps in better convergence.

Let's start with **Experiment 1** by increasing the number of timesteps in the noise scheduler. Here are the changes needed:

experiment.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    parser.add_argument("--num_timesteps", type=int, default=100)
=======
    parser.add_argument("--num_timesteps", type=int, default=200)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

You can now run the first experiment with the following command:

```bash
python experiment.py --out_dir=run_1
```

Once you have evaluated the results, let me know, and we can proceed with the next experiment.

####   
#### Your goal is to implement the following idea: Diffusion with meta learning.  
#### The proposed experiment is as follows: Diffusion model using meta learning to improve performance..  
#### You are given a total of up to 4 runs to complete the necessary experiments. You do not need to use all 4.  
####   
#### First, plan the list of experiments you would like to run. For example, if you are sweeping over a specific hyperparameter, plan each value you would like to test for each run.

#### YOUR PROPOSED CHANGE MUST USE THIS COMMAND FORMAT, DO NOT ADD ADDITIONAL COMMAND LINE ARGS.  
#### You can then implement the next thing on your list.  

To implement diffusion with meta-learning, we can plan the following experiments:

1. **Run 1: Meta-Learning with MAML (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning)**
   - Implement MAML to adapt the diffusion model's parameters for each dataset.
   - This will involve modifying the training loop to include meta-training and meta-testing phases.

2. **Run 2: Meta-Learning with Reptile**
   - Implement Reptile, a simpler alternative to MAML, which involves fewer gradient steps.
   - This will require changes to the training loop to incorporate Reptile's update mechanism.

3. **Run 3: Meta-Learning with ANIL (Almost No Inner Loop)**
   - Implement ANIL, a variant of MAML that freezes the feature extractor and only adapts the final layer.
   - Modify the training loop to reflect this approach.

4. **Run 4: Meta-Learning with Prototypical Networks**
   - Implement Prototypical Networks, which use a different approach by learning a metric space.
   - This will involve changes to the model architecture and training loop.

Let's start with **Run 1: Meta-Learning with MAML**. We will modify the training loop in `experiment.py` to include MAML. Here are the changes:
